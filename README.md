# Data-Structures-implement-a-Polynomial-ADT-using-Linked-Lists
In this project, you will implement a Polynomial ADT using Linked  Lists. You will implement the Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction  operations of polynomials. Your program should be able to read a file of polynomials called  equations.txt and store each equation in a doubly-linked list. Once the  file is read and equations are loaded into the linked lists, the user  should be able to perform mathematical operations on the  polynomials (addition, subtraction, and multiplication). Once the user  select an operation through a menu, the output should be displayed  and then the menu should show again. Another option for the user is  to store the results of all operations in a file called results.txt. Your  application should show an appropriate screen with menu options to  inform the user of the available operations to let her/him to choose  from.
